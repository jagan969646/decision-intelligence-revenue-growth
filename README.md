[# Executive Decision Intelligence System for Revenue Growth](https://decision-intelligence-revenue-growth-jjnundmymtpnrc3m7seyie.streamlit.app/)

## Business Problem

Most organizations generate large volumes of customer and transaction data but struggle to convert insights into executive decisions.

This project builds an **end-to-end Decision Intelligence System** that:
- Forecasts revenue under multiple scenarios
- Segments customers for targeted strategies
- Simulates ROI for investment decisions
- Quantifies downside risk for leadership planning

## Solution Overview

The system integrates:
- Customer segmentation (RFM + clustering)
- Time-series revenue forecasting (SARIMAX)
- Scenario-based planning (Best / Base / Worst)
- ROI simulation by customer segment
- Risk and sensitivity analysis
- Interactive executive dashboard (Streamlit)

The goal is **decision confidence**, not just prediction accuracy.
